Once you've created all the time slots you wish to create, you can export the schedule for easily viewing reservations.

For teachers, this can be done from the dashboard using the "Export Schedule" button.

For admins, you may export all time slots for all teachers or for the teachers you have selected. To export all time slots, find the "Export" button next to the search box. Alternatively, once you have a selection of teachers, find the "Export Selection" button from the group of selection actions.
