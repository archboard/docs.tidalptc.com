## Teachers

For teachers, your dashboard has a snapshot of your reservations and a way to export your reservations as an Excel file.

The calendar can be viewed as a single day, three days or a week (7 days). You can use the arrow on the right to move the days/weeks forward or backward in time.

The "Update Availability" button will take you to your Time Slots page to create and modify your time slots. Finally, you can export your schedule with the "Export Schedule" button to have all your upcoming time slots exported in an Excel spreadsheet.

## Guardians

Guardians will have a section on the dashboard that shows their upcoming time slots and quick links to view and make reservations.
