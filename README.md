## Installing locally

If you want to quickly install for local testing follow the instructions below:

### Requirements

You must be running **Node version 12 or higher** due to the Tailwind 2.0 release. I recommend using NVM to easily manage your Node versions if you need to switch back and forth between older versions.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional)

**To find your current node version:**

```
node --version
```

### Step one

```
git clone https://github.com/archboard/docs.tidalptc.com
```

### Step two

Install the dependencies and start a development server and you'll be able to work on your site with hot reloads and some nice Browsersync features.

```
# Move into the directory
cd docs.tidalptc.com

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

You should be able to visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and view the site.
