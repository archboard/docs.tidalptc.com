There are basically two ways time slots get created. A teacher can set up and configure their own slots, or an administrator can do it for them. For the days when there's school-wide conferences, admins can create many time slots simultaneously, drastically reducing the time it takes to set up.

For teachers to create their own time slots, head over to the Availability page from the top navigation. Alternatively on the Dashboard you can find the "Update Availability" button.

For admins to create time slots on behalf of teachers, this can be done by edit the availability of individual teachers or by selecting a set of teachers and creating slots for the selection.
