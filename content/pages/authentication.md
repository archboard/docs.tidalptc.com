Before you can start using Tidal PTC, you need to log in. You don't have to create any special account for Tidal PTC because it uses your PowerSchool account to create your user account and log in.

First, you'll need to log in to your PowerSchool server, either as a teacher, admin or guardian. Once you log in, click on the Applications launcher in the top right of the page.

The process is the same for teachers, admins, and guardians.

## Using a username and password

Depending on your district's setup, you may also be able to use your email and a password you configure for your Tidal PTC account. After you have created a password for your account, you may be able to use this method without having to log in to PowerSchool first.

## PowerSchool Single Sign On (SSO)

If you have a PowerSchool version of 20.11 and above, you can also log in to PowerSchool using the "Sign in with PowerSchool" button on the login page.

If you're already logged in to PowerSchool as an admin, teacher, or guardian, you will be seamlessly logged in to Tidal PTC. If you're not logged in, you will be prompted to log in as a teacher, admin, or guardian. Once you log in to PowerSchool you will be redirected back to Tidal PTC successfully authenticated.
