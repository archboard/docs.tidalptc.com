Tidal PTC (parent-teacher conferences) is a complete PowerSchool integration to manage your parent-teacher conferences. It seamlessly pulls data from your PowerSchool server and gives you a low-config solution for teachers or admins to create time slots. Guardians can then reserve the slots with their students' teachers.

This documentation contains all of the details of the application for each type of user: admin, teacher and guardian. At any time you may reference the <a href="https://demo.tidalptc.com" target="_blank">demo application</a>. The data resets each hour, so feel free to modify data and use the application in the same way you would use your own instance.

For setup instructions, choose the instructions based on your plan: [Cloud](/setup/cloud/), [Private Managed](), or [Self Hosted]().

If you have already set up your app and you want to learn how to use it, check out how to [log in](authentication).
