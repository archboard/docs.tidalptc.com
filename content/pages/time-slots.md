Time slots are the central purpose of Tidal PTC. Each time slot has flexible options that can be tailored to your school's routine and needs.

Teachers can set up their own time slots, or admins can do it for multiple teachers simultaneously. Guardians can reserve time slots, request translators, and choose between online or in-person meetings.

Get started with [creating](/time-slots/create/) or reserving time slots.
