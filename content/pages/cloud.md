Once you have purchased the Cloud plan, you will need to provide a few details to get your subscription up and going.

1. The first thing you'll need to decide is your district/school's subdomain. This will likely be an acronym or name by which you are easily known. You will access Tidal PTC from [name].tidalptc.app.

2. The next piece of information is the admin email address of the user that will manage the account for your district/school. This needs to match the email address that is stored for your PowerSchool admin user account.

3. You will need to download the Tidal PTC PowerSchool plugin. There are two options for plugins, depending on your version of PowerSchool. Version 20.11 of PowerSchool introduced a new way to authenticate using single sign on (SSO). After downloading the appropriate version, you can [install the plugin](/setup/plugin-install/) on your PowerSchool version.
